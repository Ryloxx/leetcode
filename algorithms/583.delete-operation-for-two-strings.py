# Testcase Example:  '"sea"\n"eat"'
#
# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps
# required to make word1 and word2 the same.
#
# In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make
# "eat" to "ea".
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
# Output: 4
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
# word1 and word2 consist of only lowercase English letters.
