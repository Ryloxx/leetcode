# Testcase Example:  '3'
#
# There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs,
# thenÂ you turn off every second bulb.
#
# On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or
# turning off if it's on). For the i^th round, you toggle every i bulb. For the
# n^th round, you only toggle the last bulb.
#
# Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation: At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
# After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
# After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
# After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off].
# So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 0
# Output: 0
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: n = 1
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 0 <= n <= 10^9
