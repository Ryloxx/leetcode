# Testcase Example:  '2\n1'
#
# There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls. Except
# for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining
# corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.
#
# The square room has walls of length pÂ and a laser ray from the southwest
# corner first meets the east wall at a distance q from the 0^th receptor.
#
# Given the two integers p and q, return the number of the receptor that the
# ray meets first.
#
# The test cases are guaranteed so that the ray will meet a receptor
# eventually.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: p = 2, q = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back
# to the left wall.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: p = 3, q = 1
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= q <= p <= 1000
#
