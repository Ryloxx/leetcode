 * Total Submissions: 69.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]'
 *
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.
 *
 * A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in
 * that row or column (i.e., changing all 0's to 1's, and all 1's to 0's).
 *
 * Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score
 * of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.
 *
 * Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves
 * (including zero moves).
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
 * Output: 39
 * Explanation: 0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0]]
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 20
 * grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
