 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]'
 *
 * There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n -
 * 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where
 * graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is
 * an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].
 *
 * A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe
 * node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal
 * node (or another safe node).
 *
 * Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer
 * should be sorted in ascending order.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
 * Output: [2,4,5,6]
 * Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
 * Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from
 * either of them.
 * Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or
 * 6.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
 * Output: [4]
 * Explanation:
 * Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to
 * node 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == graph.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * 0 <= graph[i].length <= n
 * 0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1
 * graph[i] is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
 * The graph may contain self-loops.
 * The number of edges in the graph will be in the range [1, 4 * 10^4].
