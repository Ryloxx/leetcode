 *
 * A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of
 * units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can
 * jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
 *
 * Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order,
 * determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone.
 * Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must
 * be 1 unit.
 *
 * If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1,
 * k, or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the
 * 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone,
 * then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to
 * the 8th stone.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between
 * the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 <= stones.length <= 2000
 * 0 <= stones[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * stones[0] == 0
 * stonesÂ is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
