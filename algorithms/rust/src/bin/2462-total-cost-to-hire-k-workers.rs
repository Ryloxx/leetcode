 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost
 * of hiring the i^th worker.
 *
 * You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly
 * k workers according to the following rules:
 *
 *
 * You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
 * In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either
 * the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie
 * by the smallest index.
 *
 * For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the
 * first hiring session, we will choose the 4^th worker because they have the
 * lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
 * In the second hiring session, we will choose 1^st worker because they have
 * the same lowest cost as 4^th worker but they have the smallest index
 * [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the
 * process.
 *
 *
 * If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker
 * with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
 * A worker can only be chosen once.
 *
 *
 * Return the total cost to hire exactly k workers.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
 * - In the first hiring round we choose the worker from
 * [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by
 * the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
 * - In the second hiring round we choose the worker from
 * [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2
 * + 2 = 4.
 * - In the third hiring round we choose the worker from
 *   [17,12,10,7,11,20,8].
 * The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that
 * the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
 * The total hiring cost is 11.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
 * - In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The
 *   lowest
 * cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The
 * total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common
 * in the first and last 3 workers.
 * - In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest
 * cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
 * - In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We
 *   choose
 * the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index
 * 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
 * The total hiring cost is 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= costs.length <= 10^5
 * 1 <= costs[i] <= 10^5
 * 1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length
 *
