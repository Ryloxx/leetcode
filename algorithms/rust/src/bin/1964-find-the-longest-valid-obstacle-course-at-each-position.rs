 *
 * You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a 0-indexed integer
 * array obstacles of length n, where obstacles[i] describes the height of
 * the i^th obstacle.
 *
 * For every index i between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), find the length of the
 * longest obstacle course in obstacles such that:
 *
 *
 * You choose any number of obstacles between 0 and i inclusive.
 * You must include the i^th obstacle in the course.
 * You must put the chosen obstacles in the same order as they appear in
 * obstacles.
 * Every obstacle (except the first) is taller than or the same height as the
 * obstacle immediately before it.
 *
 *
 * Return an array ans of length n, where ans[i] is the length of the longest
 * obstacle course for index i as described above.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: obstacles = [1,2,3,2]
 * Output: [1,2,3,3]
 * Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
 * - i = 0: [1], [1] has length 1.
 * - i = 1: [1,2], [1,2] has length 2.
 * - i = 2: [1,2,3], [1,2,3] has length 3.
 * - i = 3: [1,2,3,2], [1,2,2] has length 3.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: obstacles = [2,2,1]
 * Output: [1,2,1]
 * Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
 * - i = 0: [2], [2] has length 1.
 * - i = 1: [2,2], [2,2] has length 2.
 * - i = 2: [2,2,1], [1] has length 1.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: obstacles = [3,1,5,6,4,2]
 * Output: [1,1,2,3,2,2]
 * Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
 * - i = 0: [3], [3] has length 1.
 * - i = 1: [3,1], [1] has length 1.
 * - i = 2: [3,1,5], [3,5] has length 2. [1,5] is also valid.
 * - i = 3: [3,1,5,6], [3,5,6] has length 3. [1,5,6] is also valid.
 * - i = 4: [3,1,5,6,4], [3,4] has length 2. [1,4] is also valid.
 * - i = 5: [3,1,5,6,4,2], [1,2] has length 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == obstacles.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * 1 <= obstacles[i] <= 10^7
