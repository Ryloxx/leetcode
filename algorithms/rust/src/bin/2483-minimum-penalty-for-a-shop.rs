 * Testcase Example:  '"YYNY"'
 *
 * You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed
 * string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':
 *
 *
 * if the i^th character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the i^th
 * hour
 * whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the i^th hour.
 *
 *
 * If the shop closes at the j^th hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated
 * as follows:
 *
 *
 * For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty
 * increases by 1.
 * For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty
 * increases by 1.
 *
 *
 * Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum
 * penalty.
 *
 * Note that if a shop closes at the j^th hour, it means the shop is closed at
 * the hour j.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: customers = "YYNY"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * - Closing the shop at the 0^th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
 * - Closing the shop at the 1^st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
 * - Closing the shop at the 2^nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
 * - Closing the shop at the 3^rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
 * - Closing the shop at the 4^th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
 * Closing the shop at 2^nd or 4^th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is
 * earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: customers = "NNNNN"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 0^th hour as no customers
 * arrive.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: customers = "YYYY"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 4^th hour as customers
 * arrive at each hour.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= customers.length <= 10^5
 * customers consists only of characters 'Y' and 'N'.
