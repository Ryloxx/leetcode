 * Testcase Example:  '[1,5,2]'
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with
 * this array: player 1 and player 2.
 *
 * Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both
 * players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes
 * one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or
 * nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The
 * player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are
 * no more elements in the array.
 *
 * Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players
 * are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return
 * true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,5,2]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.
 * If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If
 * player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).
 * So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.
 * Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between
 * 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
 * Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to
 * return True representing player1 can win.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 20
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^7
 *
