 *
 * In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.
 *
 * The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the
 * Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this
 * change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can
 * exercise one of the two rights:
 *
 *
 * Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his
 * rights in this and all the following rounds.
 * Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have
 * rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory
 * and decide on the change in the game.
 *
 *
 * Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The
 * character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then
 * if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.
 *
 * The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last
 * senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of
 * voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during
 * the procedure.
 *
 * Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for
 * his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and
 * change the Dota2 game. The output should be "Radiant" or "Dire".
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: senate = "RD"
 * Output: "Radiant"
 * Explanation:
 * The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next
 * senator's right in round 1.
 * And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right
 * has been banned.
 * And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he
 * is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: senate = "RDD"
 * Output: "Dire"
 * Explanation:
 * The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next
 * senator's right in round 1.
 * And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right
 * has been banned.
 * And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's
 * right in round 1.
 * And in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he
 * is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == senate.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * senate[i] is either 'R' or 'D'.
