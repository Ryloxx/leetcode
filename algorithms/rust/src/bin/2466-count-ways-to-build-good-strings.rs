 *
 * Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by
 * starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the
 * following:
 *
 *
 * Append the character '0' zero times.
 * Append the character '1' one times.
 *
 *
 * This can be performed any number of times.
 *
 * A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length
 * between low and high (inclusive).
 *
 * Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed
 * satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it
 * modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation:
 * One possible valid good string is "011".
 * It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011".
 * All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= low <= high <= 10^5
 * 1 <= zero, one <= low
