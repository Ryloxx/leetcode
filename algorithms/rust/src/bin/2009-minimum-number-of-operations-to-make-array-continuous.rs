 * Testcase Example:  '[4,2,5,3]'
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can replace any
 * element in nums with any integer.
 *
 * nums is considered continuous if both of the following conditions are
 * fulfilled:
 *
 *
 * All elements in nums are unique.
 * The difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in nums
 * equals nums.length - 1.
 *
 *
 * For example, nums = [4, 2, 5, 3] is continuous, but nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
 * is not continuous.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations to make nums continuous.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: nums is already continuous.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,5,6]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: One possible solution is to change the last element to 4.
 * The resulting array is [1,2,3,5,4], which is continuous.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,10,100,1000]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: One possible solution is to:
 * - Change the second element to 2.
 * - Change the third element to 3.
 * - Change the fourth element to 4.
 * The resulting array is [1,2,3,4], which is continuous.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 *
