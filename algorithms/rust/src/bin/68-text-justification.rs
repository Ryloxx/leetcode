 * Testcase Example:  '["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text",
 * "justification."]\n16'
 *
 * Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such
 * that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and
 * right) justified.
 *
 * You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many
 * words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that
 * each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
 *
 * Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If
 * the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the
 * empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the
 * right.
 *
 * For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space
 * is inserted between words.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space
 * characters only.
 * Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed
 * maxWidth.
 * The input array words contains at least one word.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text",
 * "justification."], maxWidth = 16
 * Output:
 * [
 * "This    is    an",
 * "example  of text",
 * "justification.  "
 * ]
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"],
 * maxWidth = 16
 * Output:
 * [
 * "What   must   be",
 * "acknowledgment  ",
 * "shall be        "
 * ]
 * Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall
 * be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of
 * fully-justified.
 * Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only
 * one word.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: words =
 * ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","
 * to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth =
 * 20 Output:
 * [
 * "Science  is  what we",
 * ⁠ "understand      well",
 * "enough to explain to",
 * "a  computer.  Art is",
 * "everything  else  we",
 * "do                  "
 * ]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= words.length <= 300
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
 * words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.
 * 1 <= maxWidth <= 100
 * words[i].length <= maxWidth
