 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,7]'
 *
 * Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several
 * stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is
 * an integer given in the array stoneValue.
 *
 * Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's
 * turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining
 * stones in the row.
 *
 * The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The
 * score of each player is 0 initially.
 *
 * The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner
 * is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game
 * continues until all the stones have been taken.
 *
 * Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
 *
 * Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win, or "Tie" if they
 * will end the game with the same score.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: values = [1,2,3,7]
 * Output: "Bob"
 * Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three
 * piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]
 * Output: "Alice"
 * Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to
 * win and leave Bob with negative score.
 * If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's
 * score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value =
 * -9 and lose.
 * If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's
 * score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value =
 * -9 and also lose.
 * Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario
 * that makes her win.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: values = [1,2,3,6]
 * Output: "Tie"
 * Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if
 * she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will
 * lose.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= stoneValue.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * -1000 <= stoneValue[i] <= 1000
 *
