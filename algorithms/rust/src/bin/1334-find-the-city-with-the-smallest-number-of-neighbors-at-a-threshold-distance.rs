 * Testcase Example:  '4\n[[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]]\n4'
 *
 * There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where
 * edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted
 * edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer
 * distanceThreshold.
 *
 * Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable
 * through some path and whose distance is at most distanceThreshold, If
 * there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.
 *
 * Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to
 * the sum of the edges' weights along that path.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold
 * = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
 * The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
 * City 0 -> [City 1, City 2]
 * City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3]
 * City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3]
 * City 3 -> [City 1, City 2]
 * Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but
 * we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]],
 * distanceThreshold = 2
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
 * The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
 * City 0 -> [City 1]
 * City 1 -> [City 0, City 4]
 * City 2 -> [City 3, City 4]
 * City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
 * City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3]
 * The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 <= n <= 100
 * 1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
 * edges[i].length == 3
 * 0 <= fromi < toi < n
 * 1 <= weighti,Â distanceThreshold <= 10^4
 * All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.
