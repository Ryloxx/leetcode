#
# Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing
# order, and an integer k.
#
# Return the k^th positive integer that is missing from this array.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
# Output: 9
# Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The
# 5^thÂ missing positive integer is 9.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2^nd missing
# positive integer is 6.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
# 1 <= k <= 1000
# arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length
#
#
#
# Follow up:
#
# Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?
