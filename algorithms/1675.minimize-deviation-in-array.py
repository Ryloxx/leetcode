# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'
#
# You are given an array nums of n positive integers.
#
# You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any
# number of times:
#
#
# If the element is even, divide it by 2.
#
#
# For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the
# last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].
#
#
# If the element is odd, multiply it by 2.
#
# For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the
# first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].
#
#
#
#
# The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements
# in the array.
#
# Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number
# of operations.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2],
# then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3],
# then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: nums = [2,10,8]
# Output: 3
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == nums.length
# 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
#
