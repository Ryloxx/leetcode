#
# An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3,
# and 5.
#
# Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 6
# Output: true
# Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are
# limited to 2, 3, and 5.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: n = 14
# Output: false
# Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
#
