# Testcase Example:  '[3,2,1,4]'
#
# You are given an integer array prices representing the daily price history of
# a stock, where prices[i] is the stock price on the i^th day.
#
# A smooth descent period of a stock consists of one or more contiguous days
# such that the price on each day is lower than the price on the preceding day
# by exactly 1. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.
#
# Return the number of smooth descent periods.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
# [3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
# Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the
# definition.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
# Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 â‰  1.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: prices = [1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5
#
