# Testcase Example:
# '[[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]'
#
# You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]
# indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.
#
# Return a list answer of size 2 where:
#
#
# answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
# answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
#
#
# The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.
#
# Note:
#
#
# You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
# The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same
# outcome.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: matches =
# [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
# Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
# Explanation:
# Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
# Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
# Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
# Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
# Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
# Explanation:
# Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
# Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
# Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= matches.length <= 10^5
# matches[i].length == 2
# 1 <= winneri, loseri <= 10^5
# winneri != loseri
# All matches[i] are unique.
