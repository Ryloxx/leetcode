# Testcase Example:  '"abaca"\n[[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]'
#
# There is a directed graph of n colored nodes and m edges. The nodes are
# numbered from 0 to n - 1.
#
# You are given a string colors where colors[i] is a lowercase English letter
# representing the color of the i^th node in this graph (0-indexed). You are
# also given a 2D array edges where edges[j] = [aj, bj] indicates that there is
# a directed edge from node aj to node bj.
#
# A valid path in the graph is a sequence of nodes x1 -> x2 -> x3 -> ... -> xk
# such that there is a directed edge from xi to xi+1 for every 1 <= i < k. The
# color value of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the most
# frequently occurring color along that path.
#
# Return the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph, or -1 if
# the graph contains a cycle.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored "a"
# (red in the above image).
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
#
#
# Input: colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == colors.length
# m == edges.length
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 0 <= m <= 10^5
# colors consists of lowercase English letters.
# 0 <= aj, bjÂ < n
